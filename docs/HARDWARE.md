## Remarks

* Install the Raspberry Pi in the most ventilated place you can, hot temperatures will slow down the processing speed or even things stop working.

* Wi-Fi coverage is limited, if you notice any connection problem while configuring try to be closer to Raspberry Pi.

* It should run with any screen resolution but cannot ensure that graphics would render 100% perfect.

* You can connect the USB coming from the K-Pro to any USB port from the Raspberry, doesn't matter.

* Cigarette lighter is a good power source location to feed this system.

* Strongly recommended the Raspberry case, you don't want an electronic board in direct contact with your chassis.
