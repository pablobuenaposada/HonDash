# KEYBOARD

HonDash offers the possibility to use a USB keyboard as switch panel.

Any keyboard should work but most likely what you want is what is called `numeric keypad` like [this](https://www.trust.com/en/product/22221-xalas-usb-numeric-keypad).

Current available buttons and its function are:

`0`: start/stop a data logging session

`1`: switch between day and night mode

`2`: switch between different screen templates

`3`: debug screens
